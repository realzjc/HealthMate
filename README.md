<!-- 
Whether you're looking to get fit, eat healthier, or manage stress, HealthMate acts as your knowledgeable guide, orchestrating specialized AI agents to deliver the best possible support. -->

## ‚ú® Features

* **Multi-Agent Architecture:** 
    A central `HealthManager` intelligently routes your requests to specialized agents:
    * üèãÔ∏è **Fitness Agent:** Provides workout advice, exercise demonstration videos, and helps create fitness plans.
    * üçé **Nutrition Agent:** Offers dietary guidance, finds healthy recipes based on your preferences (scraping from the web!), and breaks down nutritional info.
    * üß† **Mental Care Agent:** Supports emotional well-being, suggests calming music (from YouTube!), and provides guidance on stress management and sleep.
* **Interactive UI:** 
    Built with Chainlit for a seamless and engaging chat experience, including custom UI elements for recipes and exercise videos.
* **Personalization:** 
    Remembers user profile details (age, gender, height, weight) using a local SQLite database.
* **External Tool Integration:** 
    Leverages Semantic Kernel plugins to:
    * `FitnessPlugin`: Scrape websites for fitness videos.
    * `NutritionPlugin`: Search and extract recipes.
    * `MentalCarePlugin`: Find relevant music on YouTube.
    * `SmtpPlugin`: Send email summaries or confirmations.

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

HealthMate employs a multi-agent architecture coordinated by Semantic Kernel. 

The user interacts with the Chainlit UI, sending messages to the central `HealthManager` agent. The `HealthManager` analyzes the request and routes it to the appropriate specialist agent (`Fitness`, `Nutrition`, or `MentalCare`). 

Specialist agents utilize their unique instructions and dedicated plugins (like web scraping, database queries, or music search) to fulfill the request, returning the information to the `HealthManager` and then back to the user.

**Core Components:**

* **Chainlit:** Provides the frontend chat interface and manages user sessions.
* **Semantic Kernel:** Orchestrates the overall workflow, manages plugins, and interacts with AI models.
* **Azure AI Agents:** Hosts the specialized agents (Fitness, Nutrition, MentalCare) defined with specific instructions and tools (plugins). Uses GPT-4o-mini.
* **Azure OpenAI Service:** Provides the underlying LLMs
* **Plugins:** Modular components (`.py` files in `/plugins`) that give agents specific skills (web scraping, database access, API calls, etc.).

### Prerequisites

* **Python:** Version 3.10+ recommended.
* **Git:** To clone the repository.
* **Azure Account & Services:**
    * An active Azure subscription.
    * An Azure OpenAI resource with eg. **GPT-4o-mini** deployed (for the `HealthManager`).
    * An Azure AI Studio/Foundry project with three **Azure AI Agents** created using the eg. **GPT-4o** model (Fitness, Nutrition, MentalCare). 

    Set agent prompts in `agents/*.py` files. Note the `Agent ID` for each. For each agent, upload the corresponding PDF from the `knowledge/` folder into the **Knowledge** section of Azure AI Studio to enable RAG-based responses:

| Agent            | Knowledge PDF File                                      | Description                                |
|------------------|---------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| FitnessAgent     | ACE-Personal-Trainer-Manual-PDFDrive-.pdf              | Exercise science and workout planning      |
| NutritionAgent   | Dietary_Guidelines_for_Americans_2020-2025.pdf         | Official dietary guidance and nutrition    |
| MentalCareAgent  | therapists_guide_to_brief_cbtmanual.pdf                | Cognitive behavioral therapy and mental care |
